# ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
* Placeholder wagons
* Special train station where trains are fixed
* What if all locomotives are destroyed?
	- allow train to only go to specific station
	- low top speed
* Problems crashing into each other
* Startup setting
*


# LIMITAIONS:
* Equipment is inserted into cargo inventory first and only moved if the item request is fulfilled completey.
* The check whether a train is complete again is relatively simple. It doesn't wait for all item requests to be fulfilled and can't tell the difference between different entities of the same type.
*


# VANILLA BUGS:
* Orientation of locomotives. --> REPORTED
*


# INTERFACE REQUESTS:
* Way to cluster item-request icons in ghosts like it does for locomotives. --> REQUEST POSTED
* Let item-request-proxy target specific inventories/grid. --> REQUEST POSTED
*
