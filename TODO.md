# GENERAL

# ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:
* Placeholder wagons
* Special train station where trains are fixed
* What if all locomotives are destroyed?
	- allow train to only go to specific station
	- low top speed
* What if trains crash into each other?
*


# BUGS/LIMITAIONS:
* If multiple rolling stock were destroyed, the automatically enabling automatic mode doesn't work properly in most cases.
* The check whether a train is complete again is relatively simple. It doesn't wait for all item requests to be fulfilled and can't tell the difference between different entities of the same type.
* Equipment is inserted into cargo inventory first and only moved if the item request is fulfilled completey.
*


# INTERFACE REQUESTS:
* Way to cluster item-request icons in ghosts like it does for locomotives. --> REQUEST POSTED
* Let item-request-proxy target specific inventories/grid. --> REQUEST POSTED
